# Time Series Forecasting Model using Meta's Prophet

# Project Overview
This project showcases a time series forecasting model developed using Meta’s Prophet library and a Kaggle dataset. The objective is to provide accurate, reliable forecasts for time-dependent data, leveraging Prophet's strengths in handling seasonality, holiday effects, and irregular data intervals. The model is versatile and can be adapted for various applications, including predicting trends in business, finance, or other domains with seasonal data patterns.

# Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes structured, time-stamped data suitable for forecasting. Key data preparation steps included handling missing values, normalizing date formats, and organizing the dataset to align with Prophet’s input format. This structured dataset is then divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's accuracy.

# Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure compatibility with Prophet.
2. Model Training: Trained Prophet on historical data, tuning parameters to optimize forecast accuracy.
3. Forecasting: Generated forecasts for future time points, including predictions for seasonal patterns and holiday effects.

# Conclusion
By leveraging Prophet’s capabilities, this project provides a robust forecasting tool that accommodates various time series patterns and trends. The project demonstrates a practical approach to time series forecasting, using real-world data and accessible ML tools to deliver actionable predictions.
